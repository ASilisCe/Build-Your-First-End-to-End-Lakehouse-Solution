> [!TIP]
> Autotune query tuning examines individual queries and builds a distinct ML model for each query. It specifically targets:
> - Repetitive queries
> - Long-running queries (those with more than 15 seconds of execution)
> - Spark SQL queries (excluding those written in the RDD API, which are very rare)
>
> This feature is compatible with notebooks, Spark Job Definitions, and pipelines.
