# Build Your First End to End Lakehouse Solution

> [!NOTE]
> Sunday, March 24, Workshop Hours: 9 am â€“ 4 pm 

Join our lakehouse workshop to learn how you can build your own modern end-to-end data solutions using Microsoft Fabric. Gain hands on experience as we guide you through Fabric data integration capabilities including pipelines and dataflows to land data in your lakehouse. Next you will learn how you can further transform your data using notebooks and Spark, and organize, secure, and prepare all your data for serving. Finally, you will learn how different data personas including BI analysts and data scientists can leverage and build on top of the lakehouse data. 

By the end of this workshop, you should be well versed in Fabric Data Integration & Data Engineering topics and capable of building an end-to-end workflow that includes ingesting, preparing, serving and operationalizing your data solution.
