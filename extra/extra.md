# Specify the file format and compression type for the sink datasets in Data Factory

# Specify the File Format and Compression Type for Sink Datasets in Data Factory

Based on Wikipedia, Snappy (formerly known as Zippy) is a fast data compression and decompression library developed by Google. It prioritizes high speed over maximum compression, offering significant speed benefits: 250 MB/s compression and 500 MB/s decompression using a single core of a circa 2011 2.26 GHz Core i7 processor. However, it provides 20â€“100% lower compression ratio compared to gzip. For more details, you can refer to the [Snappy article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(compression)).

Given this information, you might question the decision to use gzip instead of Snappy and how you can modify this setting. Here's how to proceed:

1. Navigate to Data Factory and open the first pipeline you have created, which loads raw data into a bronze Lakehouse.
2. In the pipeline, go to the 'Source' tab and then click 'Settings'.
3. The next step is to review all the compression types supported for the Parquet format. Deciding on the correct compression type can be challenging; therefore, let's compare the two main types: Snappy and gzip.

   - **Snappy**: As noted from Wikipedia, it is designed for high speed rather than maximum compression.
   - **Gzip**: This compression tool does not specifically consider the data structure within the file, but often results in better overall compression for Parquet files.

Your choice should be guided by what you intend to do with the data being loaded into the bronze layer and how it will be used subsequently, for example, whether it will be moved to the silver or gold layers and how frequently it will be accessed.

You can change your compression type in the settings menu of the source tab:

Based on benchmarks, gzip is more suited for long-term static storage, making it the preferred choice for data in the Gold layer. For data that is accessed more frequently (hot data), Snappy or LZO might be better options:

Choosing the right compression type depends on your specific needs: data access patterns, storage costs, and performance requirements.

# Medallion architecture
A Medallion architecture is a data design pattern used to organize data in a Lakehouse, with the goal of progressively improving the quality and structure of the data as it flows through each layer of the architecture, starting from the Bronze layer, then to the Silver layer, and finally to the Gold layer.

![image-alt-text](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/243714iAF59794D11862CC4/image-dimensions/521x259?v=v2)

This incremental and progressive improvement enables you to maintain data quality and structure while also improving data processing performance. Medallion architectures are sometimes referred to as "multi-hop" architectures because data flows through multiple layers.

One of the main benefits of a Lakehouse architecture is that it provides a simple data model that is easy to understand and implement. Additionally, it enables incremental ETL (extract, transform, load) operations, which means you can add new data to the Lakehouse in a scalable and manageable way.

Another benefit of a Lakehouse architecture is that it allows you to recreate your tables from raw data at any time. This is possible because Delta Lake provides ACID transactions and time travel capabilities, allowing you to track changes to your data and easily roll back to previous versions if necessary.

## Medallion architecture in Fabric Lakehouse

After performing data cleaning and transformation on your Lakehouse data, you can save the resulting data back to another Lakehouse to reflect the "bronze->silver->gold" pattern.

Here's an example code snippet that shows how you can write data to another Lakehouse:

```python
# read data from the bronze Lakehouse
bronze_df = spark.read.table("bronze_lakehouse_name.lakehouse_table")

# perform data cleaning and transformation
# ...

# write the transformed data to the silver Lakehouse
transformed_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("silver_lakehouse_name.lakehouse_table")

```
In this example, we first read data from the bronze Lakehouse using the spark.read method. We then perform data cleaning and transformation on the bronze_df DataFrame. Finally, we write the transformed data to the silver Lakehouse using the transformed_df.write method, specifying the path to the silver Lakehouse and setting the save mode to "overwrite" to replace any existing data.

Our real case, one more time:

```python
table_name  = "green201501"

data_collection = table_name[:-6]  # Extracts all characters except the last six (assumes these are non-digits)
extracted_year = table_name[-6:-2]  # Extracts the four digits representing the year
extracted_month = table_name[-2:]  # Extracts the last two digits representing the month

from pyspark.sql.functions import col, year, month, dayofmonth, avg

# !!!!
# READING RAW DATA FROM DEFAULT (RAW) LAKEHOUSE
df = spark.read.table(table_name)

# Calculate average fare amount per month
average_fare_per_month = (
    df
    .groupBy(year("lpep_pickup_datetime").alias("year"), month("lpep_pickup_datetime").alias("month"))
    .agg(avg("fare_amount").alias("average_fare"))
    .orderBy("year", "month")
)
display(average_fare_per_month)

result_table_name = f"{table_name}_avg_fare_per_month"

# Save the results to a new delta table - SILVERCLEANSED LAKEHOUSE - SILVER LAYER
average_fare_per_month.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable(f"silvercleansed.{result_table_name}")
```
